   <p>A robust Q4 pushed 2015 European office take-up to its strongest annual level since 2008. Occupier market activity accelerated in H2 on the back of a Eurozone upturn, with the impact of concerns about global developments limited. While cities continue to move at very different speeds, the overall direction is up, with prime rents in 18 of the 24 index markets now up from their previous trough.</p>
