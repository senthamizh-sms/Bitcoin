	<p>In Q2 2016, office leasing was down 4% y-o-y. However, excluding the UK, European take-up grew by 3% y-o-y, a clear sign of the upbeat sentiment on the continent. While in London leasing has clearly been affected in the run up to, and following, the EU referendum, general sentiment elsewhere in Europe is one of 'business as usual' with continued levels of activity as recorded in recent quarters.</p>
