   <p>Despite concerns about global market fluctuations and the impending EU vote in the UK, forecasts suggest further economic recovery across Europe in 2016. Overall, we expect demand for office space to remain strong this year, with take-up in line with the robust 2015 performance. While quarterly rental growth was marginally slower compared with Q4 2015, this is not unusual for the first three months of the year and general sentiment continues to be positive.</p>
